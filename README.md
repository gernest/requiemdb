# Why a sad name ?

I'm sad, I have run out of savings trying to bootstrap a web analytics company
[vince](https://github.com/vinceanalytics/vince). I have a big gap since my last employment so no one replies to my
email applications anymore.

My dream is gone, and so is my livelihood. I am desperate, anyone out there who
is looking for a humble, mid-level software engineer please give me a chance, I promise
you won't be disappointed (My email is on my profile).
